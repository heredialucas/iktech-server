### Workflow

In this repository, we follow a workflow based on best practices to maintain an organized and collaborative development process. The following are the steps and practices you should follow when contributing to this project:

1. **Git Flow**: We use the Git Flow workflow to organize our branches. Development primarily takes place in the `development` branch, while the `main` branch contains stable versions of the project.

2. **Conventional Commits**: To facilitate understanding and tracking of changes, we use Conventional Commits. This involves writing descriptive and structured commit messages in the format specified by Conventional Commits.

3. **Pull Requests**: To incorporate changes into the repository, create a Pull Request from a feature or bug fix branch to the `development` branch. Be sure to include a clear description of the changes and reference related issues.

4. **Code Review**: Code submitted via Pull Requests will be reviewed by the team. Special attention is given to code quality, best practices, and test coverage. Comments and suggestions may be made to improve the implementation.

5. **Merge to `development`**: Once a Pull Request has been reviewed and approved, the changes will be merged into the `development` branch.

6. **Clean Code and Testing**: We expect submitted code to be clean, readable, and following project style conventions. Additionally, it is important to include appropriate unit or integration tests for new features or bug fixes implemented.

7. **Documentation**: We request the addition of for any new implementation or significant change. Within the `Documentation` folder, clear instructions should be provided to test new features and any relevant information for developers.

We appreciate your collaboration and effort in following these recommended practices. Together, we can maintain an organized and high-quality repository.

If you have any questions or need assistance during the contribution process, feel free to reach out to the team.

Thank you for being part of this project!
